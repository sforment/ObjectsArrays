    const team = players;

        // You might think we can just do something like this:

    team[2] = 'stefan';
    console.log(team, players);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = 'stan';

    // one way
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    console.log(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];

    console.log(players);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

       // THIS IS ONLY CREATING A REFERENCE NOT A COPY!!!

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Stefan', number: 13, age: 29});
    console.log(cap2);
    console.log(person);//STILL SHOWING(NUMBER:99 FROM THE REFERENCE EXAMPLE LN83-84)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread(ITS HERE!!!)

    const cap3 = {...person};
